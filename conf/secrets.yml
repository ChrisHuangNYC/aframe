# used to store authentication credientials that will be used over and over again
# all automations with a 'password_lookup' field will search this file for the key entered into the text box
# this allows you to change authentication information in a single place and all your automations

# FIXME - I will eventually write a plugin for this so the user can write their own, more security conscience, pluging
# if necessary
